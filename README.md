# FinalProject_SoftDev
This is repository for final project of Software Development course.

Goal: To create routes from a user-defined point "A" to a point "B" available in a CSV file using the networkx package and visualize it with folium.

Approach: 
1. Create the CSV file with sport facilities data, or the destination points, and their coordinates.
2. Prompt the user to input point "A".
3. Use networkx to find the shortest path from "A" to "B."
4. Visualize the route on a map using folium.
